I'm a graduate student pursuing M.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). Previously, I received B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and B.S. in Mathematics (with Honors) from UT Austin.

My research focuses on Machine Learning, especially understanding the **theoretical foundations** and improving the **generalization** of models, such as diffusion models and mixture-of-experts models. Currently I work as a Research Assistant at [VITA](https://vita-group.github.io/group.html) lab.

<!-- I'm passionate about exploring **real-world applications** as well as the **theoretical understandings** behind ML algorithms. -->

You can find my CV here: [Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
