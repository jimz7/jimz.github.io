I'm a graduate student pursuing an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. I hold dual B.S. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Mathematics (with Honors) from UT Austin.

My research focuses on machine learning and computer vision, especially understanding and improving the generalization of models. Currently I work as a Research Assistant at [VITA](https://vita-group.github.io/group.html) lab.

I'm passionate about advancing AI technology and exploring its real-world applications, as well as the theoretical understandings behind.
